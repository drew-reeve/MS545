                    <h3>Factors to consider when choosing a business structure:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Number of owners</li>

    <h3>Who defines the structures?</h3>
    <p>State Incorporation Laws, IRS, and Federal Requirements all dictate how a business structure is defined.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Guest Speaker - Jeremy Johnston, Game Developer "The Roottrees are Dead"</h2>
    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>He developed and created the game The Roottrees are Dead which has recently gained popularity. He talked about the start and growth of the idea at Game Jams and how he was initially able to flesh out the idea in a classroom at UAT.</li>
        <li>He talked about releasing the game and the outlets he utilized in further development of the game. For example, using online communities such as Discord and Reddit.</li>
        <li>His experience was interesting because he initially released the game for free seeking donations, but never really focused on the monetization of the game.</li>
        <li>Passion and being a huge fan of his own game and its development seemed to be a key theme that helped Jeremey be successful at releasing the game.</li>
        <li>He talked about stumbling on an interested investor and developer who jumped on board to re-make and release the game without the AI Artwork (which was the rational for a free-release of the game concept).</li>
        <li>Part of his experience with successful game development and launch he attributed to luck and chance. However, I believe his behaviors and community engagement really helped getting the exposure he needed to stumble upon and create the relationships he needed to be successful.</li>
        <li>Important lessons when monetizing a game:
            <ul>
                <li>Initial investment and development costs are paid back first.</li>
                <li>Some games are successful because of luck and chance opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Other generally important lessons he learned and noted:
            <ul>
                <li>Constant iterations that incorporate end-user feedback allow the game to morph and grow as it is developed.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In his experience he first developed an “under-cooked” storyline and back stories. User-feedback ultimately provided the need for more meaningful content and a better game.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are many different paths and ‘happy accidents’ that occur in the development of a game, that when addressed appropriately, can greatly enhance the final product.</li>
                <li>Playtest with all types of end-user (players) as possible – constructive and critical feedback is vital.
                    <ul>
                        <li>He attributed this to making the game more flexible by providing better user experience and playability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As a developer – we are our harshest and worst critics. We often forget this. </li>
                <li>Tutorials and how you ease users into the playability of a game are very important. He advised not to be afraid of making games harder in earlier-on stages to introduce important information and mechanics of a game.
                    <ul>
                        <li>But don’t frontload everything – gradually adding in more ‘tutorials’ for game mechanics is also an important factor to keep in mind.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Localization and translating a game into different human languages can be a very tricky and challenging process and may take more time and effort to implement than intially thought and expected. It’s important to consider your ROI (return on investment) when doing this.</li>
                <li>Hint systems and how they are implemented are important to consider when developing a game. His advice is that there is no reason to shame or gatekeep puzzle game players when considering the ability to ‘cheat’ and move forward features that are built into the game.</li>
                <li>Don’t over-antagonize players unless you really intend to. It’s not a good strategy if you want to be a likable and recommendable game.</li>
                <li>He notes that positivity and passion are important characteristics to embody in game development.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rhythm Racer Business Plan Development (Discussion Post/Assignment)</h2>
    <p> This sections highlights the primary post that was used in the Canvas Discussion boards for the class.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <h3>Prompt: Tell us the important details about the company you are using for this class.</h3>
    <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Rhythm Racer</p>
    <p>I have been partnered with a team working on a game project entitled “Rhythm Racer” that is being developed at UAT by students. The game is a racing-style game that looks to add in rhythmic features and functionality of music and song. The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5. The project is currently in week 9 of a 15 week project timeline. I am just getting to meet the team and have started to get a better understanding of the game and development stage they are at.</p>

    <h3>Prompt: What business structure would you recommend based on the project / company you have chosen?</h3>
    <p>The business structure that I have chosen for this business plan is to create a Limited Liability Company (LLC) for the reasons outlined and detailed below:</p>

    <h3>Prompt: Evaluate and Justify why.</h3>
    <p>There are a variety of important factors that have led me to decide on forming an LLC for Rhythm Racers. The first and arguably one of the most important is the fact that LLC’s combine the benefits of sole proprietorship with the limited liability projection of corporations. This allows the owners (team members and stakeholders) to not be generally liable for the company’s debts or legals issues. LLC’s also provide for desirable benefits such as pass-through taxation – meaning the company is not directly taxed but rather profits and losses are reported on the owner’s personal income tax returns – this avoids double taxation.</p>
    <p>Some of the other important factors that went into the decision to elect an LLC are because LLC’s provide for operational and management flexibility over that of a corporation. This is a small team with a short timeline – flexibility and the ability to adapt quickly are paramount in-order to ensure on-time deliverability and completion without major delays and setbacks that can often come from big corporations that require a lot more formal documentation, change management and tracking, and approvals for changes.</p>
    <p>Another important factor to keep in mind is that LLC’s are relatively cheap and easy to form. This flexibility is desirable for a small team and project like Rhythm Racer. LLC’s typically do not require nearly as much formal documentation, agreements, contracts, profit/loss projections, etc as say the formation of larger corporations with deeper pockets and more stringent demands/requirements from shareholders/stakes holders.</p>
    <p>Further rational for choosing an LLC business structure over sole proprietorship or a partnership are because of the liability protection provided to the owners and members of the LLC.</p>
     </blockquote>

    <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
        <li>Why is the information we covered in class important? Why did we spend our valuable time learning it?</li>
        <ul><li>Because choosing the right type of business structure can have grandiose affects on your business growth and development down the road (both positive and negative).</li></ul>
        <li>How do you plan to use it in the future?</li>
        <ul><li>Having the skillset to build and develop a business plan and select the approriate business structure is a strong marketable skill to showcase in a resume or portfolio. I will use it as such. </li></ul>
        <li>What information would you add to this lesson to gain additional insight on the topic?</li>
        <ul><li>Nothing to note. The guest speaker really helped bring in a real-world application perspective that I found extremely interesting and beneficial.</li></ul>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Below is my Week 0.5 Teachback Journal:</p>

            <ul><h2>Journal:</h2>
                    <li>Tasks performed this week included:</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Build Teach Back Journal Website</li>
                        <li>Review Course Introduction Material for the class</li>
                        <li>Completed First-day Survey</li>
                        <li>Attended and Reviewed the Live Lecture</li>
                        <li>Reviewed Module Content (Course Overview Powerpoint)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                    <li>For the first 0.5 week of the course I attended the live session and built a simple website to showcase my course work. After reviewing the powerpoint that was presented in class I learned about the important aspects that will be covered in this class specically related to legal and administrative sides of the economics of the gaming industry.</li>
                <h2>Teachback:</h2>
                    <li>What did you learn this week in class?</li>
                    <ul><li>I learned this week in class that our main project for the class will be building a business plan for a fictional gaming company. I have elected to work with a group that is working on an actual game to add a better real-world experience in developing the fictional business plan.</li>
                    <li>The general layout and design of the course and its contents on UAT's Canvas along with what the assignments and course content looks like.</li>
                    <li>We learned about funding sources for gaming companies and how complex they can be. We learned about the importance of legal issues and are reminded that the professor is not a lawyer. We learned about the complexities of employees and employee relations and how to handle expectations. The lecture also covered the intricacies of opening a bank account for a gaming business and the legal issues to be concerned about to ensure proper licencing and ownership.</li>
                <li>The lecture also covered the importance of insurance and how to work around problems that may arise with IP (Intellectual Property). We learned about the realities of game funding and what realistic expectations of financial gain are. Finally we learned about some out-side sources to go to for support when you feel like you are alone.</li></ul>
                    <li>How does this information relate to things you have studied in other classes or earlier in this course?</li>
                    <ul><li>The information is relatable because it gives an insight to the business side of coding and gaming. Whereas other courses have looked at the more technical aspects of game and application design, this couse focuses on the business development side. </li></ul>
                    <li>What material stood out to you? How did your view of the industry / job of producer change based on what you learned?</li>
                    <ul><li>All of the material related to the salary and financial gain aspect of the gaming industry stood out to me. I feel like it is a common mistake for all people to think that creating and maintaining a profitable buisness comes easy. From what I have seen, studied, researched and have been told by those with real world experience - this simply is not the case - and furthermore that a lot of businesses don't make it very far at all.</li></ul>
                <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
                    <li>Why is the information we covered in class important? Why did we spend our valuable time learning it?</li>
                    <ul><li>
                        The business and financial side of the gaming industry is extremely important to understand. It is the foundation of any business and without it, a business will not be able to survive. We spent our valuable time learning it because it is essential to understand how to manage a gaming company effectively, from funding to legal issues, and employee relations.</li>
                    </li></ul>
                    <li>How do you plan to use it in the future?</li>
                    <ul><li>I plan to apply the information learned in class in the real world when approaching interaction and transactions in the gaming industry. I hope having a deeper understanding of the business side of operations will help make me a better student, employee, and leader.</li></ul>
                    <li>What information would you add to this lesson to gain additional insight on the topic?</li>
                    <ul><li>Nothing to note so far being that it is only the first 0.5 week of class.</li></ul>
