                    <li>How does this information relate to things you have studied in other classes or earlier in this course?</li>

                    <li>Why is the information we covered in class important? Why did we spend our valuable time learning it?</li>

                    <li>What information would you add to this lesson to gain additional insight on the topic?</li>
                <h2>Guidelines and Expectations</h2>
                    <p>The Journal will take the form of an essay/blog on the experience I had from a Leadership, Strategy, and/or Production perspective.</p>

                            </blockquote>
                            <p>After a couple of hours, I reached the summit. The view was breathtaking. Peaks upon peaks stretched out before me, all covered in pristine snow. It felt like I was on top of the world, in a place untouched by the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It was just me, the mountains, and the quiet hum of the wind.</p>
                            <p>The descent was much fasterâ€”and way more fun! I found a few good slopes to slide down, laughing like a kid as I tumbled into soft snowbanks. It was a perfect end to a perfect day.</p>
