    <h1>Lecture 5.1: Intellectual Property</h1>

    <h2>What is IP?</h2>
    <p>Ideas or intangible creations that can be owned solely by an individual. Based on the idea that government can control who is able to utilize the idea. Examples include trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents, etc.</p>

    <h2>IP: Trade Secret</h2>
    <p>Just keep the process or some aspect of the product secret (like a secret recipe). These are free to have but extremely hard to keep in today’s gaming industry because of the prevalence of hacking, digital leaks, reverse engineering, etc.</p>
    <p>NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements) can be used to attempt to mitigate and protect trade secrets but are not fool proof.</p>

    <h2>IP Type: Copyright</h2>
    <p>Exclusive rights given to the creator of some type of creative work fixed in a tangible form of expression. Typically has a limited time period. Originally it just meant the right to copy the work – now in most places in the world once it is written down it is copyrighted. In the US you must register the copyright to receive damages. Does not protect just raw ideas – only after they are expressed or fixated.</p>
    <p>In the gaming industry copyrighting typically covers a variety of different aspects of the game design and development. The music, art, and code of the game are copyrighted are covered by different areas of US copyright law.</p>

    <h2>IP Type: Trademark</h2>
    <p>Historically there was some sort of mark (i.e. phrase, word, symbol or design) allowing you to distinguish between other products. Typically has geographical and industry specific limitations. Needs to be registered in-order to be enforceable.</p>

    <h2>IP Type: Patent</h2>
    <p>Used to protect inventions – and therefore can cover some aspects of game development. Allows you to protect and exclude others from making, offering, or selling an ‘invention’ for a certain time frame in the US.</p>
    <p>Gives you legal protection but requires a lot of work to get set-up and established. Seek legal advice if this is the avenue you choose.</p>

    <h3>GDC Talk Take-a-ways (Practical IP Law for Indie Developers 301: Plain Scary Edition):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Copyrighting</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Copyright and trademark enforcement can be really expensive when infringed upon – but the reward for pursuing it may be worth it.</li>
                <li>You need to be really careful to also not violate copyright laws yourself in your own game development.</li>
                <li>Fair use copyright infringement can be extremely complicated.</li>
                <li>License and enforce your contracts and IP as best as you can – don’t be afraid to do so – it is an important aspect of game development.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Trademarks</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Trademark rights do not take affect until you have actually sold official copies of the game you have developed. You can however register for a trademark in advance to reserve that IP for up to 3 years – you do have to actually sell in the future to actually get the rights.</li>
                <li>Registering a trademark is best done with strong legal help and should not be over looked. Also utilize legal help when sending down take down requests or cease and desist orders. Suing is very expensive.</li>
                <li>Register your trademark as soon as you can if you intend to have value in your brand and trademark.</li>
                <li>Avoid infringement – do your research and proper due diligence to avoid future heartache. Plan ahead.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Patents</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Not worth it for indies.</li>
                <li>Can be really expensive and difficult to obtain.</li>
                <li>Seek legal help if you feel this is necessary.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Trade Secrets</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use reasonable efforts to keep things secret.</li>
                <li>Enforce NDAs.</li>
                <li>Simply don’t expose your secrets openly to the world.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Right of Publicity</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Name, Image, Likeness can be very tricky.</li>
                <li>Avoid where possible to avoid issues.</li>
            </ul>

    <h1>Lecture 5.2: Other Revenue Sources</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract Work:</strong> Lots of opportunities out there to help work on other projects and further other game development.</li>
        <li><strong>Porting, Consulting and Bug Fixes:</strong> Finding work to help others out there finish and release their gaming project.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Game Software Development:</strong> Focusing where other software development and coding demands are prevalent – outside of the gaming industry. May have to focus here and push ‘game-development’ as a side-project.</li>
        <li><strong>"Many Small Projects":</strong> Small achievable goals allow you to accomplish smaller project to really showcase your game development skills and game’s creative idea.</li>
        <li><strong>Asset Stores and Assets:</strong> Monetizing other aspects of your game.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Media / Teaching / Training / etc.:</strong> Utilizing the process of developing your game and monetizing it in other ways – such as social media or as educational development.</li>

    <h2>GDC Talk: Flopping Successfully: Running a Studio Without a Huge Hit</h2>
    <p>2023 Talk by Yngvill Hopen, founder of Henchman & Goon</p>
    
    <h2>Key takeaways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Henchman & Goon, a studio based in Bergen, Norway, has released three games: Flem, PodE, and Pode:Kids. They started working on Pode, an ambitious project, in 2015 and launched it on the Nintendo Switch in 2018, where it initially performed poorly.</li>
        <li><strong>Survival Philosophy:</strong> The studio operates on the principle that ‘artists too need to eat’ - meaning that they must be practical and responsible to sustain themselves. In their early years, they took on contract work to survive while developing their first game, Flem.</li>
        <li><strong>Studio Split and Funding:</strong> A difference in vision led to a friendly split of the company, with Yngvill’s group focusing on game development. After four years of effort, they secured funding to focus on Pode.</li>
        <li><strong>Redefining Success:</strong> The initial failure of Pod was disheartening, but the game's sales slowly improved over time, eventually recovering its costs by 2022. This led the studio to shift its priorities from sales numbers to:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Survival</strong> - Ensuring the well-being and work-life balance of the team.</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoying the Process</strong> - Always finding joy in the creation of art.</li>
                <li><strong>Managing Expectations</strong> - planning for the possibility of failure to ensure the team's happiness and safety. Always be clear and open about your true intentions and capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Community and Continued Success</strong> - the long-term success of Pode she attributes to its quality, positive reviews, and a strong community.</li>
                <li><strong>Love What You Make</strong> - enjoy the process doing it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yngvill advises developers to set life goals, not just product goals, and to prioritize self-care and team well-being. She emphasizes that it's not necessary to be ‘number one’ to be successful and that their focus has shifted to taking on interesting contract work with great people.</p>
    <p><strong>Remember – game developers too have to eat!</strong></p>

    <h2>GDC Talk: How to Run a Studio Without a Surprise Hit</h2>
    <p>2019 Talk by Christopher Langmuir, Theresa Duringer and Tanya X at Anemoney Hug Interactive, Temple Gate Games, and Kitfox respectively.</p>

    <h3>Chris at Anemone Hug Interactive: Client Work and Original IP</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remember to act like a business</strong> - Don't neglect the business aspects of running a studio, such as legal matters and accounting.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversity in your team</strong> - client work provides stable income, allowing for a more diverse and talented team.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare!</strong> - Have at least a year of funds before you start, secure credit while you're still employed, and get a mentor.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding Client Work</strong> - Always be networking! Offer solutions instead of just labor, and look for clients in games-adjacent industries.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance is a Challenge</strong> - Be aware that client work can be creatively draining and that splitting time between client projects and your own games doesn't mean you'll finish your own games any faster or slower.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Theresa at Temple Gate Games: Hardware and IP Partnerships</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Indie Reality</strong> - Most indie games are not huge successes. The key is to find a way to survive in the middle ground.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage New Hardware</strong> - Developing for new hardware can lead to funding from manufacturers.
            <ul>
                <li>Pro Tip: Utilize lesser-known platform to get your name known and to show your development capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use IP Partnerships</strong> - Partnering with existing intellectual property holders can open doors and help you build relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management</strong> - Be Strategic! Use smaller projects like expansion packs for a steady income stream and stick to a specific genre to maximize your ROI (return on investment).</li>
        <li><strong>Know Your Audience and Stick to What you Know (Stick to a Genre)</strong> - It's easier to make games for an existing player base than to build one from scratch.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversify Your Income</strong> – She too stresses the idea to not rely solely on game sales.
            <ul>
                <li>Pro Tip: supplement your income with things like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grants,</li>
                        <li>Work-for-hire</li>
                        <li>Partnerships</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tanya at Kitfox Games: Diversification and Fan Engagement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Long-term survival</strong> - the goal is to continuously improve your games, which requires the studio to survive and the team to be happy.</li>
        <li><strong>Be opportunistic and diversified</strong> - Be open to different funding sources to ensure survival, which will lead to a variety of games and revenue streams.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralize Your Brand</strong> - Focus on building a community around your studio's brand, not just individual games.</li>
        <li><strong>Community! Engage with Your Fans</strong> - Once again stressing the importance of community development - actively connect with your fans to build a strong relationship with your studio.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Transparency and Diversification</strong> - Game sales are not the only sources of income. Kitfox Games also utilizes:
            <ul>
                <li>Kickstarter</li>
                <li>Outside investments</li>
                <li>Contract work</li>
                <li>Lots of odds and ends to help boost the bottom line – even just by a little.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no single ‘Right Way’ to run A Game Development Company - Every studio is different, and there are many paths to success.</p>

                        <h1>Module 4.0: Publishing</h1>

    <h2>Lecture 4.1: Why You Need a Publisher</h2>
    <p>Last week's main takeaway (the professor was gone) was to know the important difference between contractors and employees. Contractors may at first sound like an easier and cheaper route to get a project done—it may not always turn out that way.</p>

    <h3>Historically:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You had to sell physical copies of your game.</li>
        <li>There were no ways to download and pay for games online.</li>
        <li>Placement and marketing of your physical game were important sales factors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Today's Publishers</h3>
    <p>Funding is still a secondary element of funding. The primary goal is to get games to market and the logistics to do so:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distribution</li>
        <li>Price/Cost & Profit Sharing</li>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>Platform Standardization</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things to consider when dealing with publishers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They want to get a quality product to market as successfully as possible.</li>
        <li>They are profit-seeking and want to get the best ROI as possible.</li>
        <li>They want to publish to as many platforms and in as many languages as possible.</li>
        <li>They push timelines and can assist with project management.</li>
        <li>They may already have the market access and knowledge you need.</li>
        <li>They may have Intellectual Property (IP) rights and expertise to pass on to your game/project.</li>
        <li>They worry about brand standards and brand management.</li>
        <li>They want your game to be as successful as possible so they can make as much money as possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When selecting a publisher to work with, make sure you have a <strong>GOOD FIT</strong>. They can have a huge influence on what game is developed and produced. Make sure the publisher aligns with your mission, vision, values, and goals.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Research and due diligence will help mitigate this and help you select the best publishers that fit you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>EDC Europe Presentation Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring the Developer + Publisher = Partnership</li>
        <li>The importance of trust and long-term relationship development.</li>
        <li>Trust is a rare commodity in the relationship between game development and publishers and is extremely important. Get to know your publisher well (previous games, marketing, business philosophy, etc.).</li>
        <li>Marketing is an important dynamic in the relationship between publishers and developers. Publishers take over and have a huge say in the marketing aspects of game development. Trust your publisher has the experience and know-how to run a successful marketing campaign.</li>
        <li>Utilize your 'power gamers' to extract solid and useful marketing material and game development inputs. Communication (even small amounts) is crucial.</li>
        <li>Under-promise and exceed expectations. Do not over-promise anything. Be 100% certain that what you are marketing about the game ends up in the actual game.</li>
        <li>Remember—marketing is not everything. You also must produce a quality game and product to back up good quality marketing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Important takeaway:</strong> Limit your scope. Limiting the scope of your game allows you to focus on what is important in your game development. Benefits and insights that come from limiting and focusing scope:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gameplay (focuses your efforts on core features)</li>
        <li>Miscalculation minimization—a more specific scope allows for mitigation when miscalculations in development happen.</li>
        <li>Iterate features—discover what resonates with your game players.</li>
        <li>Helps in the business development side of the project.
            <ul>
                <li>Keeping the money close to the developers also provides and creates an avenue for strong and improved communication to limit friction.</li>
                <li>Mitigates risk.</li>
                <li>Allows you to ensure ROI on what works.</li>
                <li>Pleases investors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Marketing also benefits from a limited scope.
            <ul>
                <li>Allows developers to focus on features that the target audience is vocal about.</li>
                <li>Smaller releases allow you to act and not just react quickly to new releases and developments in the game.</li>
                <li>Gives marketing an easier time and way to say “THIS GAME IS FUN!”</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ideal times to partner with publishers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you are broke and need money for further game development.</li>
        <li>When you are seeking/needing marketing and sales support.</li>
        <li>When your knowledge of the specific industry & market is limited.</li>
        <li>Allows you to focus on just development—publishers can provide all of the other important parts that are needed for successful development and release.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Real-world examples talked about in class include <em>No Man’s Sky</em> and <em>Alganon</em> and how their development and interaction with a publisher was crucial in their release and post-release reception.</p>

    <h3>EDC San Francisco Talk “So You’re Ready to Pitch to a Publisher? – You’re Not”</h3>
    <p>Before you pitch, make sure that you understand:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What you are making</li>
        <li>Audience</li>
        <li>The Pitch itself</li>
        <li>Key-deliverables and takeaways</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Talk Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Be realistic with your sales projections (you will likely not sell/release beyond 30,000 copies)—manage realistic expectations.</li>
        <li>Prototypes are simply proof that you are working on something.
            <ul>
                <li>Publishers do not pay for prototypes.</li>
                <li>Multiple prototypes are necessary to establish proof of concept.</li>
                <li>Create a 'vertical slice' prototype to prove proof of concept to excite publishers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Lecture 4.2: Why You DON’T Need a Publisher</h2>
    <p>Games are no longer available in just hard copy and are widely available online for digital download.</p>
    <p>Digital distribution is extremely important now, accounting for (>95%) of game distribution. Digital storefronts are much more common and an easy avenue to release games (with or without a publisher).</p>

    <h3>Self Publishing is now totally possible and feasible:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Steam as an example:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>$100 'Bet' initially that your game will get off the ground.</li>
                <li>SteamWorks includes a plethora of features and benefits to utilizing their platform (i.e., player data, matchmaking abilities, multiplayer functionality, etc.).</li>
                <li>Provides access to a large market and audience.</li>
                <li>Steam does 'Marketing' for your game.</li>
                <li>A store page is provided.</li>
                <li>Steam gets 30% and wants you to succeed and be successful so they can make money as well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Epic Games Store:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Epic only takes 12%.
                    <ul>
                        <li>0% until you make $1 MILLION a year.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Epic Online Services
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar to SteamWorks but not as exhaustive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Exclusivity deals.</li>
                <li>Epic will 'advance' funds to games in development in some cases to help them reach completion.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The money advance will need to be paid back.</li>
                        <li>Epic may require exclusivity for a set amount of time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Epic is willing to eat fees (like credit card) for smaller games in hopes that big games will be attracted to and developed on the Epic Games store platform—and they will be able to really cash in on those big hit games.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What does Self Publishing actually cost you?</h3>
    <p>Publishers have a lot of access to important relationships that really enhance and encourage the development and successful release of games, including areas such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NO Marketing Support</li>
        <li>NO Free Partnerships</li>
        <li>Access to some funding (like 'advances on royalties')</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GDC Talk: No More Robots – Publishers Guide to Not Need a Publisher</h3>
    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-publishing requires a lot of self-direction and self-initiative.</li>
        <li>The release and announcement process of a game is an integral part of development and should not be taken lightly.</li>
        <li>Getting potential players interested in your game requires a lot of communication and ground-level connection. Feedback is crucial.</li>
        <li>Grass-roots push for game recognition requires a lot of work on your part without a publisher. To be successful, be prepared to do a lot of 'cold calling' to get your game out there and known.</li>
        <li>The actual launch of a game requires a lot of planning and preparation—and will be extremely stressful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Remember to ask yourself:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Am I capable of releasing this game on my own without outside support?</li>
        <li>Can I pull this off with a reasonable amount of success?</li>
        <li>Could someone else do this for you? (PR Company)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Discussion 4.1 Post: </h2>
        <blockquote>
        <h2>Company Description:</h2>
    <p>A company founded on developing and releasing student led gaming projects. The company will pilot and test it’s business strategy and structure with a game being developed by UAT students entitled “Rhythm Racer”. That project is outlined and described below.</p>

    <h2>Project description:</h2>
    <p>Rhythm Racer is an atmospheric driving rhythm game in which players will enjoy a narrative scenic drive. Depending on the genre of the song each environment will differ giving players variation. While they enjoy not only the challenge of the rhythm of the song there will be a small story paired alongside it. This game is being developed over 15 weeks for a course led by students at UAT. This game is being developed with the Unreal 5 Engine.</p>

    <h2>Partner with a Publisher?: Yes or No</h2>
    <p>I have opted to partner with a self-publishing approach at this stage in the business for a variety of reasons. Big digital gaming platforms like Steam can provide essential tools and exposure for even small indie-level games. This is particularly important for this company and project because the company is still working on a ‘proof-of-concept’ to build on and develop further. That concept – building solid business models for student developed games and releasing them – is still being tested and developed with the first project described here.</p>
    <p>Self-publishing on Steam gives access to important marketing tools (like a storefront) at a relatively small cost (an initial non-refundable fee of $100 that is recouped if the game gets off the ground). This is very important for this project because the students that are developing this game do not have the marketing and sales knowledge to easily accomplish crucial marketing functions such as building and promoting a store page.</p>
    <p>Additionally, working with a publisher allows the students to have a showcase product at the end of the project. Even if the game does not garner much attention – it can still live in the Steam Game Library that the students can than showcase in their portfolios.</p>
    <p>Other important features that Steam can provide when self-publishing include access to community engagement features, automatic updating, cloud functionality, and more.</p>

    <h2>Further Research</h2>
    <p>After investigating working with publishers, some argue that innovative thinking and artistic vision are not enough anymore to get a game off the ground. The current market is flooded with too many games and not enough visibility for indie-games without large pockets. Publishers are important to partner with because they can provide the raw financial power and a solid marketing strategy that are now essential for survival in the gaming industry. Simply stated – there are too many similar games out there for a low-marketing-budget indie game to be feasibly ‘discovered’.</p>
    <p>Upon further research I also stumbled upon a somewhat successful example of a student-led game project being successfully released. Back in 2020 a team of four University of Michigan undergraduate students signed a deal with a publisher (indie label Hitcents) and later released a game called ‘YOLKED – The Egg Game’ on Steam in April, 2023. Success in doing so was largely attributed to the students’ passion for the work they were doing.</p>

        <h2>My Assignment 4.1 Post: </h2>
        <blockquote>
                <p><strong>My Objective:</strong> Build a business case study to present a game development obstacle and the solution/approach used by the game developers in the form of a research paper.</p>

    <h2>Gaming Industry Business Case Study Idea 1: Half-Life and Game Modding: The Impact of the GoldSrc Engine on Game Development and the Modding Community</h2>
    <p>The Valve game Half-Life was built on a modified Quake engine (dubbed GoldSrc) - it was a highly customized and influential engine in its own right. The engine's flexibility and the developer tools provided by Valve allowed for an explosion of community-created mods, many of which became hugely successful standalone games.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research Focus:</strong> Trace the history and legacy of the GoldSrc engine. Discuss how Valve's approach to game development and their support for modders led to the creation of iconic titles like Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat. I will explore the argument that Half-Life's success as a platform for modding fundamentally changed the relationship between developers and their player base, paving the way for a new era of community-driven content.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Concepts to Explore:</strong> Game engines, modding, community development, platform development</li>
        <li><strong>Addresses Course Objective 4</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gaming Industry Business Case Study Idea 2: The Steam Platform and The Transition from Physical to Digital Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Steam platform has fundamentally reshaped the video game industry since its inception. Steam's initial purpose was to streamline the patching process for Valve's own games like Counter-Strike and Half-Life 2, but it quickly evolved into the dominant digital storefront for PC games. This transition was a pivotal moment in the industry.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research Focus:</strong> Analyze how Steam's rise challenged and ultimately changed the traditional retail model of game distribution. Discuss the advantages for developers (i.e. lower production and shipping costs, direct relationship with players) and for consumers (i.e. instant access, automated updates). I will explore the criticisms, such as the loss of game ownership in favor of licenses and the impact on the used game market.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Concepts to Explore:</strong> Digital rights management (DRM), distribution models, retail vs. digital, consumer rights</li>
        <li><strong>Addresses Course Objectives 4, 5</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gaming Industry Business Case Study Idea 3: Student Led Dev Teams: Overcoming Technical Challenges with Limited Resources</h2>
    <p>Student developers often work with free tools, limited budgets, and a lack of access to high-end hardware or software. This scarcity forces them to be creative in their approach to game development.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research Focus:</strong> Investigate the strategies students use to overcome these resource limitations. Discuss the importance of using free assets, open-source game engines (like Godot), and a focus on minimalist art styles to create polished games. I will explore how these constraints can sometimes lead to more innovative and focused game design decisions, as developers are forced to prioritize core gameplay over graphical fidelity.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Concepts to Explore:</strong> Frugal innovation, resource management, minimalist design, asset pipelines, indie development.</li>
        <li><strong>Addresses Course Objectives 4</strong></li>

    <p>Depending typically on experience and seniority. Typically outlined (from top to bottom) as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead</li>
        <li>Principle</li>
        <li>Senior</li>
        <li>(no prefix)</li>
        <li>Junior</li>
        <li>Associate</li>
        <li>Assistant</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A note on Agile Development</h2>
    <p>Commonly found in the gaming industry but works differently. An important strategy and work dynamic to understand as it is often utilized.</p>
    <p>Only 3 Roles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensures Agile methodologies are followed and runs Sprint Retrospection and helps with that process.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents the game to ensure the best possible product is made.</li>
                <li>Runs the Sprint Review meeting and signs off on work performed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Team Member</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Everyone else.</li>
                <li>The team as a whole defines and decides roles of the ‘team members’ and the tasks they perform and are responsible for.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Size will likely determine the number and type of roles (and role-crossovers) a company has.</li>
        <li>AI in the gaming world is different from what some may consider now in the real world (i.e. Generative AI, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc.).</li>
        <li>Building your game/project of existing technology is advised and encouraged (like utilizing Unreal Engine instead of designing and developing your own game engine).</li>
        <li>Don’t be the ‘smartest person’ on the team – it’s not solely your game anymore – let the team do the work they are there for.</li>
        <li>Selecting and staying on the right team and electing the right role for you in the process of game development is very important to keep in mind. Happy developers typically create great games.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Lecture 3.2: Contractors vs. Employees</h2>
    <p>It is important to consider if you are going to have fulltime employees or contract out certain aspects of the game and project under development. Employees require a lot of costs that may not be directly related to the game in development (such as benefits). Contractors may be more specialized and cheaper to hire for really specific tasks. It is important to consider all details when deciding to elect to hire employees or work with outside contractors.</p>

    <h3>Factors and Costs to consider:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Payroll Taxes (social security, unemployment, etc.)</li>
        <li>Benefits (health insurance, dental, retirement, etc.)</li>
        <li>Profit Sharing (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Employee Development (Tradeshows, Conventions, Training, etc.)</li>
        <li>Equipment / Workspace Costs</li>
        <li>Insurance and Legal Costs (don’t forget about cyber security)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of these costs do not apply to contractors and therefore should be taken into consideration when deciding which type of workers to hire. Contractors will likely be cheaper but have lower levels of investment and commitment to the project.</p>

    <h3>Factors to consider when working with contractors:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Contracts</li>
        <li>Essential / Non-Essential Roles</li>
        <li>Behavior and Commitment</li>
        <li>Financial Aspects</li>
        <li>Relationship (short-term)</li>
    </ul>

                    <li>What did you learn this week in class?</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul><h3>This week’s lecture presented and addressed the following subject areas:</h3>
                    <ul><li>Funding sources to consider when writing a business plan.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Exit strategies to consider for the end-of-life of the business or project (and what your role is).</li></ul></ul>
                    
               
 
        <h2>Lecture 2.1: Money (Funding Sources)</h2>
        <p>How do you deal with the money coming in and where does it come from?</p>

      
        <h2>Sources of Funding (PROs/CONs)</h2>
        
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>You have to pay your employees, buy and maintain your equipment, pay for operation costs (bills) and many other financial obligations in order to maintain a healthy business.</p>
        
        <h3>Factors to consider when looking at funding sources:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Access and Relationship</li>
            <li>Structural Requirements</li>
            <li>Terms/Ownership</li>
            <li>Terms/Consequences of failure</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Funding Source: Friends and Family Loans</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The idea that you utilize those who you know and are close to you that would be willing to help you out. Not everyone has access to this funding source because not everyone has a rich uncle/friend willing to lend them money. Easy to negotiate terms.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Flexibility, potential quick access to funds, closer connection and drive to the project/business, usually strong self-ownership is required.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Informal, can potentially harm normally healthy relationships with friends and family, limited amount of funds (depending on how rich your uncle really is), can be a very co-dependent funding source (not allowing you to seek other sources of funding easily/if at all). Not feasible for everybody.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Make sure to have and maintain clear expectations and agreements between all parties. Be sure to run a transparent business with clear and open communication. Seek other funding sources or profitability quick to diversify funding.</p>
        
        <h3>Funding Source: Bootstrapping</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Essentially using your own financial means as a way to fund the company. This type of funding can facilitate any type of structure, ownership terms, management terms, and repayment because it is all of your own risk, money, and liability.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Include having full control over all administrative and ownership decisions which also include the easy of transferring the company/project and payback. Requires a lot of focus and discipline inorder to achieve profitability.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> You are the limited resource that finances everything – you are taking on a lot of risk (and also potential reward). May be slower in the development process because of the lack of skills and abilities. Limited access to networking and mentorship relationships that may come from other sources of funding.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Stay Lean – Reinvest your revenue – seek grants and other outside financial sources to help you when possible – seek mentorship and guidance from outside sources and mimic that who have been successful before you.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Credit Cards</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Using lines of credit as a source of funding for your company and project. Not an extremely ideal option because of the high-risk involved and the high-rate of repayment needed by the credit givers. This type of funding source can however be very flexible and facilitate any structure and ownership or management style.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Fast and easy.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Expensive and risky!</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Don’t. Seek other options first. Only use as a last resort and in cases of high-confidence of strong positive ROI (return on investment and profitability of the company/project).</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Bank / SBA Loans</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Precise terms and conditions with predictable repayment timeframe. Little to no involvement from the source of funding. Reasonable rates and terms. Longer payback timeframes.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Typically, hard to get for game development. May require collateral. Loans have to be repaid and may come with certain restrictions on what type of business you can create. No connection/lack of mentorship from funding source.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Plan ahead and make sure to have thorough and detailed plans for repayment. This includes planning for all stages of growth and development of the project or business (including start-up and no-profit times). Have a contingency plan.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Angel Investors</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Selling off the ownership, management, or some level of control of the company or project to a wealthy company or individuals that have the means to fund you. This type of funding may encompass a lot of structure requirements, ownership and management terms, and repayment stipulations.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Great opportunities for mentorship. Increase credibility of your company and/or project. No repayment obligation. Lesser financial worry and potentially beneficial flexible terms.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Multiple owners mean you have less control. Potential for disagreement and dissolution of you or the business/project. Pressure for high and quick returns. May dictate exit terms/expectations.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Do your homework and proper due diligence. Pick the right investors that have clear agreements and contracts that make sense to you. Be clear about your vision and goals to ensure you pick the right angel investor.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Venture Capital</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Essentially being invested into by a venture capital firm who sees the potential and growth of your project or company. In return they take a stake of ownership in the business. This is a very competitive funding source that comes with a plethora of structural requirements, ownership and management terms, and exit stipulations. This type of funding can come in stages and may come from a very specialized venture capital firm.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Can mean a significant investment in growth and capital. No repayment obligations (for you). Great access to networking and mentorship opportunities. The terms are clear and well known.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Very competitive and hard to secure. Can lead to equity dilution. Strong pressures for growth, profits, and success. Loss of control over management and administrative decisions. Complex terms and conditions and a dictated exit strategy (for you).</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Do your homework and proper due diligence. Pick the right investors that have clear agreements and contracts that make sense to you. Be clear about your vision and goals to ensure you work with the right venture capital firm.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Crowdfunding</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A strategy that is similar to bootstrapping and/or friend/family funding but seeks further grassroots type investment. Enables the company to sell securities (or shares) to a large group of investors online. Heavily dictated by government regulations. Must be a corporation structured business in-order to sell shares. Typically, flexible repayment obligations that can be agreed upon with shareholders. Engages in an audience that is interested in what you are trying to achieve with your business.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Surge of capital. No repayment obligations. Engaged shareholders and audience.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Equity dilution. Heavy government regulatory requirements (including lots of disclosure). Management of many investors who may be more highly engaged that in other funding sources.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Legal representation is a must – this can be a very complex and involved process. Be willing to engage with your audience and get them as heavily invested and involved in the vision and goals of the company/project as possible.</p>

        

        <h2>Lecture 2.2: Exit Strategies</h2>
        <p>What happens to the company when you are gone? How are you going to close down your company?</p>

        <h3>Key Points to Remember:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A good idea to write the ending first so you know where you are going.</li>
            <li>Investors want to know when and how they will get paid. This is also important to know the timeframe of when you anticipate cashflow to start coming in.</li>
            <li>The type of exit that you anticipate for the company can affect your work and approach to it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Some important factors to consider when choosing an exit:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Does your funding source mandate this?</li>
            <li>How likely or probable is the exit strategy?</li>
            <li>How do you want to exit your company? What is your personal-preference and does it align with your long-term goals?</li>
            <li>Market conditions and timing are also important. Is there a company out there willing to buy or consume your company or game?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Options for Exit Strategy</h2>
        
        <h3>Perpetuity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan to have the company to live on forever. It is important to keep into consideration if this is possible for you (when do you want to leave). Is the ‘default’ strategy until you define a different approach.</li>
            <li>What works with you funding source? Will there be profits to pay for the game into the future? Will you investors/funder agree to this type of exit? Don’t forget to create a process of succession.</li>
            <li>What are your long-term goals? Are you seeking a big pay-out or the ability to retire?</li>
            <li>Don’t forget about customer loyalty and the importance of branding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Acquisition or Merger</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Planning to have another company or individual buy you out.</li>
            <li>This is really good approach if you are hoping for a <strong>big-payout</strong>.</li>
            <li>Allows for your dreams of the company and/or game to live on.</li>
            <li>This is only possible if the company or project is feasible. A company will only buy you out if you are desirable.</li>
            <li>After an acquisition or merger you are losing control – your employees may also be greatly affected by new ownership and leadership. Some of them may not be needed or redundant.</li>
            <li>Once acquired the new parent company will likely want to make their money back as soon as possible and this may change internal dynamics. This may cause firings and discomfort as the company becomes more profit hungry.</li>
            <li>The negotiations for this type of exit strategy can be painful and hard. There are a lot of details that need to be ironed out between the two parties involved.</li>
            <li>It’s important to do your due diligence when utilizing this strategy. Do your research – some mergers/acquisitions may be looking to liquidate everything. Is the financial gain worth what you are giving up? Will your project/company live on the way you want it to (or is the money worth giving that up?)</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your final contracts and agreements. What will be the naming rights going forward? What does your involvement look like (if at all?). Make sure to have well-versed legal support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Go Public (IPO)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your business becomes publicly traded on the stock market.</li>
            <li>This does not happen very often – generally really large companies and gaming projects are capable of doing this.</li>
            <li>Creates an opportunity for a surge in funding and may provide a great opportunity for you to cash in (if you have stock options and the company is doing well).</li>
            <li>Provides the opportunity for you to retain control. However your company is now owned by your shareholders and their demands.</li>
            <li>Allows for stock offerings for you and your employees.</li>
            <li>This is a very complicated process. There are a lot of legal regulatory and reporting requirements. Becoming publicly traded on the stock market comes with a lot more requirements for transparency.</li>
            <li>This is not an easy process. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered in very detailed way. This may take away from the project or companies main goals/development. A lot of preparation is needed before hand when going through this process to be successful. Research!</li>
            <li>Prepare your employees for this process and be as transparent as possible in the process.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Management Buyout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A strategy where the managers buy the company or project from the owners.</li>
            <li>May be a viable option if funding is difficult or hard to get at first.</li>
            <li>Not a payout for you. You are paying your investors.</li>
            <li>May be difficult to do because the shareholders or stakeholders may not want to give up control. What is the reasoning behind this approach?</li>
            <li>Do your research and due diligence. Professional legal services will be crucial in-order as smooth as possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Similar approach to above where the employees gain ownership of the company and also reap the benefits.</li>
            <li>Payout is limited – depending on the purchasing power of your employees.</li>
            <li>Not typically preferred or feasible for a lot of funding sources (like venture capital or angel investors).</li>
            <li>Not extremely common and may be tough approach to accomplish.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Liquidation or Sell-off</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An approach that involves selling everything off and liquidating the company.</li>
            <li>May be the most viable and feasible option at the time.</li>
            <li>Important to determine and consider who owns what and what percentage of products or services, capital on-hand, intellectual property assets, etc.</li>
            <li>This can be a very fast strategy that is born out of necessity of the environment that the company or game project lives in. This can also be a very crude and dirty/tough process.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Discussion Post</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What information do we need to make an intelligent decision about the exit structure of our example company?</p>
            <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What exit strategy is best for this company and why?</p>
            <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> What are the pros and cons of this exit strategy and how do they relate directly to the information you know about the company, industry, and projects?</p>
            
            <h3>Guidelines and Expectations</h3>
            <p>Start by posting a description of your example company, any products it will be creating, and any other relevant information you think is important for making the decisions as to which exit strategy is best.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>My Discussion Post: </h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>There are several important factors that impact the exit strategy decision making process for the game development project and company that I am working with. It is also important to note that there are many factors that should be considered when deciding on an exit strategy for any business but because of the unique aspects of the project that I am working on I have gone with the following strategy outlined below.</p>
        <p>Before delving deeper into the exit strategy for the company/project here is pertinent important information that has been taken into consideration in the development of the business plan and further fleshes out the scope and details of the project.</p>
        <p>The name of the project/game being developed is “Rhythm Racer”. The team developing the game is comprised of students who are actively involved in this project for course work. The team describes the game as such:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Rhythm Racer is an atmospheric driving rhythm game in which players will enjoy a narrative scenic drive. Depending on the genre of the song each environment will differ giving players variation. While they enjoy not only the challenge of the rhythm of the song there will be a small story paired alongside it.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Essentially, a racer-type game developed with rhythmic elements and storylines played alongside music.</p>
        <p>Taking these aspects into consideration for this pseudo-fictional game development company and this project, the route I have chosen for an exit strategy is <strong>acquisition</strong>. Ultimately, in my eyes, if the game is developed and polished enough to be attractive for purchase by a bigger-larger company that can take the game and run with it that would be a win-win for those involved. This does bring in a lot of questions regarding the development of the game – however – being that it is done in an academic setting by students. Those details and stipulations need to be ironed out in the acquisition contract with the new parent company. Giving the students the experience and acclaim of selling off a game they developed would be a great success for all of those involved. Although this goal and vision may be lofty, it is still feasibly accomplishable – and therefore the exit strategy I have elected.</p>
        <p>Some other options for exit-strategies for this type of development/project/company that I considered included donating the game to the public sphere for academic use (because of how it was developed) or just simply allowing the game to run on forever (a perpetuity exit-strategy) but ultimately decided acquisition would work best in theory. There are also cons to be considered but I believe they are outweighed by the pros because of the academic value gained by the students. The cons include loss of control and ownership of the game/project, potential loss of administrative and managerial roles in the further development of the game, among other consequences of being acquired. Due diligence in the future must be taken when working on the actual contracts that implement the acquisition or merger.</p>

    <h2>Guest Speaker - Jeremy Johnston, Game Developer "The Roottrees are Dead"</h2>
    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>He developed and created the game The Roottrees are Dead which has recently gained popularity. He talked about the start and growth of the idea at Game Jams and how he was initially able to flesh out the idea in a classroom at UAT.</li>
        <li>He talked about releasing the game and the outlets he utilized in further development of the game. For example, using online communities such as Discord and Reddit.</li>
        <li>His experience was interesting because he initially released the game for free seeking donations, but never really focused on the monetization of the game.</li>
        <li>Passion and being a huge fan of his own game and its development seemed to be a key theme that helped Jeremey be successful at releasing the game.</li>
        <li>He talked about stumbling on an interested investor and developer who jumped on board to re-make and release the game without the AI Artwork (which was the rational for a free-release of the game concept).</li>
        <li>Part of his experience with successful game development and launch he attributed to luck and chance. However, I believe his behaviors and community engagement really helped getting the exposure he needed to stumble upon and create the relationships he needed to be successful.</li>
        <li>Important lessons when monetizing a game:
            <ul>
                <li>Initial investment and development costs are paid back first.</li>
                <li>Some games are successful because of luck and chance opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Other generally important lessons he learned and noted:
            <ul>
                <li>Constant iterations that incorporate end-user feedback allow the game to morph and grow as it is developed.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In his experience he first developed an “under-cooked” storyline and back stories. User-feedback ultimately provided the need for more meaningful content and a better game.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are many different paths and ‘happy accidents’ that occur in the development of a game, that when addressed appropriately, can greatly enhance the final product.</li>
                <li>Playtest with all types of end-user (players) as possible – constructive and critical feedback is vital.
                    <ul>
                        <li>He attributed this to making the game more flexible by providing better user experience and playability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As a developer – we are our harshest and worst critics. We often forget this. </li>
                <li>Tutorials and how you ease users into the playability of a game are very important. He advised not to be afraid of making games harder in earlier-on stages to introduce important information and mechanics of a game.
                    <ul>
                        <li>But don’t frontload everything – gradually adding in more ‘tutorials’ for game mechanics is also an important factor to keep in mind.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Localization and translating a game into different human languages can be a very tricky and challenging process and may take more time and effort to implement than intially thought and expected. It’s important to consider your ROI (return on investment) when doing this.</li>
                <li>Hint systems and how they are implemented are important to consider when developing a game. His advice is that there is no reason to shame or gatekeep puzzle game players when considering the ability to ‘cheat’ and move forward features that are built into the game.</li>
                <li>Don’t over-antagonize players unless you really intend to. It’s not a good strategy if you want to be a likable and recommendable game.</li>
                <li>He notes that positivity and passion are important characteristics to embody in game development.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h2>Rhythm Racer Business Plan Development (Discussion Post/Assignment)</h2>
    <p> This sections highlights the primary post that was used in the Canvas Discussion boards for the class.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <h3>Prompt: Tell us the important details about the company you are using for this class.</h3>
    <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Rhythm Racer</p>
    <p>I have been partnered with a team working on a game project entitled “Rhythm Racer” that is being developed at UAT by students. The game is a racing-style game that looks to add in rhythmic features and functionality of music and song. The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5. The project is currently in week 9 of a 15 week project timeline. I am just getting to meet the team and have started to get a better understanding of the game and development stage they are at.</p>

    <h3>Prompt: What business structure would you recommend based on the project / company you have chosen?</h3>
    <p>The business structure that I have chosen for this business plan is to create a Limited Liability Company (LLC) for the reasons outlined and detailed below:</p>

    <h3>Prompt: Evaluate and Justify why.</h3>
    <p>There are a variety of important factors that have led me to decide on forming an LLC for Rhythm Racers. The first and arguably one of the most important is the fact that LLC’s combine the benefits of sole proprietorship with the limited liability projection of corporations. This allows the owners (team members and stakeholders) to not be generally liable for the company’s debts or legals issues. LLC’s also provide for desirable benefits such as pass-through taxation – meaning the company is not directly taxed but rather profits and losses are reported on the owner’s personal income tax returns – this avoids double taxation.</p>
    <p>Some of the other important factors that went into the decision to elect an LLC are because LLC’s provide for operational and management flexibility over that of a corporation. This is a small team with a short timeline – flexibility and the ability to adapt quickly are paramount in-order to ensure on-time deliverability and completion without major delays and setbacks that can often come from big corporations that require a lot more formal documentation, change management and tracking, and approvals for changes.</p>
    <p>Another important factor to keep in mind is that LLC’s are relatively cheap and easy to form. This flexibility is desirable for a small team and project like Rhythm Racer. LLC’s typically do not require nearly as much formal documentation, agreements, contracts, profit/loss projections, etc as say the formation of larger corporations with deeper pockets and more stringent demands/requirements from shareholders/stakes holders.</p>
    <p>Further rational for choosing an LLC business structure over sole proprietorship or a partnership are because of the liability protection provided to the owners and members of the LLC.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Below is my Week 0.5 Teachback Journal:</p>

            <ul><h2>Journal:</h2>
                    <li>Tasks performed this week included:</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Build Teach Back Journal Website</li>
                        <li>Review Course Introduction Material for the class</li>
                        <li>Completed First-day Survey</li>
                        <li>Attended and Reviewed the Live Lecture</li>
                        <li>Reviewed Module Content (Course Overview Powerpoint)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                    <li>For the first 0.5 week of the course I attended the live session and built a simple website to showcase my course work. After reviewing the powerpoint that was presented in class I learned about the important aspects that will be covered in this class specically related to legal and administrative sides of the economics of the gaming industry.</li>
                <h2>Teachback:</h2>
                    <li>What did you learn this week in class?</li>
                    <ul><li>I learned this week in class that our main project for the class will be building a business plan for a fictional gaming company. I have elected to work with a group that is working on an actual game to add a better real-world experience in developing the fictional business plan.</li>
                    <li>The general layout and design of the course and its contents on UAT's Canvas along with what the assignments and course content looks like.</li>
                    <li>We learned about funding sources for gaming companies and how complex they can be. We learned about the importance of legal issues and are reminded that the professor is not a lawyer. We learned about the complexities of employees and employee relations and how to handle expectations. The lecture also covered the intricacies of opening a bank account for a gaming business and the legal issues to be concerned about to ensure proper licencing and ownership.</li>
                <li>The lecture also covered the importance of insurance and how to work around problems that may arise with IP (Intellectual Property). We learned about the realities of game funding and what realistic expectations of financial gain are. Finally we learned about some out-side sources to go to for support when you feel like you are alone.</li></ul>
                    <li>How does this information relate to things you have studied in other classes or earlier in this course?</li>
                    <ul><li>The information is relatable because it gives an insight to the business side of coding and gaming. Whereas other courses have looked at the more technical aspects of game and application design, this couse focuses on the business development side. </li></ul>
                    <li>What material stood out to you? How did your view of the industry / job of producer change based on what you learned?</li>
                    <ul><li>All of the material related to the salary and financial gain aspect of the gaming industry stood out to me. I feel like it is a common mistake for all people to think that creating and maintaining a profitable buisness comes easy. From what I have seen, studied, researched and have been told by those with real world experience - this simply is not the case - and furthermore that a lot of businesses don't make it very far at all.</li></ul>
                <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
                    <li>Why is the information we covered in class important? Why did we spend our valuable time learning it?</li>
                    <ul><li>
                        The business and financial side of the gaming industry is extremely important to understand. It is the foundation of any business and without it, a business will not be able to survive. We spent our valuable time learning it because it is essential to understand how to manage a gaming company effectively, from funding to legal issues, and employee relations.</li>
                    </li></ul>
                    <li>How do you plan to use it in the future?</li>
                    <ul><li>I plan to apply the information learned in class in the real world when approaching interaction and transactions in the gaming industry. I hope having a deeper understanding of the business side of operations will help make me a better student, employee, and leader.</li></ul>
                    <li>What information would you add to this lesson to gain additional insight on the topic?</li>
                    <ul><li>Nothing to note so far being that it is only the first 0.5 week of class.</li></ul>
