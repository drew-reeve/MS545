                <p>Below is my Week 0.5 Teachback Journal:</p>

            <ul><h2>Journal:</h2>
                    <li>Tasks performed this week included:</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Build Teach Back Journal Website</li>
                        <li>Review Course Introduction Material for the class</li>
                        <li>Completed First-day Survey</li>
                        <li>Attended and Reviewed the Live Lecture</li>
                        <li>Reviewed Module Content (Course Overview Powerpoint)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                    <li>For the first 0.5 week of the course I attended the live session and built a simple website to showcase my course work. After reviewing the powerpoint that was presented in class I learned about the important aspects that will be covered in this class specically related to legal and administrative sides of the economics of the gaming industry.</li>
                <h2>Teachback:</h2>
                    <li>What did you learn this week in class?</li>
                    <ul><li>I learned this week in class that our main project for the class will be building a business plan for a fictional gaming company. I have elected to work with a group that is working on an actual game to add a better real-world experience in developing the fictional business plan.</li>
                    <li>The general layout and design of the course and its contents on UAT's Canvas along with what the assignments and course content looks like.</li>
                    <li>We learned about funding sources for gaming companies and how complex they can be. We learned about the importance of legal issues and are reminded that the professor is not a lawyer. We learned about the complexities of employees and employee relations and how to handle expectations. The lecture also covered the intricacies of opening a bank account for a gaming business and the legal issues to be concerned about to ensure proper licencing and ownership.</li>
                <li>The lecture also covered the importance of insurance and how to work around problems that may arise with IP (Intellectual Property). We learned about the realities of game funding and what realistic expectations of financial gain are. Finally we learned about some out-side sources to go to for support when you feel like you are alone.</li></ul>
                    <li>How does this information relate to things you have studied in other classes or earlier in this course?</li>
                    <ul><li>The information is relatable because it gives an insight to the business side of coding and gaming. Whereas other courses have looked at the more technical aspects of game and application design, this couse focuses on the business development side. </li></ul>
                    <li>What material stood out to you? How did your view of the industry / job of producer change based on what you learned?</li>
                    <ul><li>All of the material related to the salary and financial gain aspect of the gaming industry stood out to me. I feel like it is a common mistake for all people to think that creating and maintaining a profitable buisness comes easy. From what I have seen, studied, researched and have been told by those with real world experience - this simply is not the case - and furthermore that a lot of businesses don't make it very far at all.</li></ul>
                <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
                    <li>Why is the information we covered in class important? Why did we spend our valuable time learning it?</li>
                    <ul><li>
                        The business and financial side of the gaming industry is extremely important to understand. It is the foundation of any business and without it, a business will not be able to survive. We spent our valuable time learning it because it is essential to understand how to manage a gaming company effectively, from funding to legal issues, and employee relations.</li>
                    </li></ul>
                    <li>How do you plan to use it in the future?</li>
                    <ul><li>I plan to apply the information learned in class in the real world when approaching interaction and transactions in the gaming industry. I hope having a deeper understanding of the business side of operations will help make me a better student, employee, and leader.</li></ul>
                    <li>What information would you add to this lesson to gain additional insight on the topic?</li>
                    <ul><li>Nothing to note so far being that it is only the first 0.5 week of class.</li></ul>
