            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outsourced Dev Team Roles</h2>
    <p>Generally (not always) it can be easier and cheaper to outsource certain aspects of game development. Those roles can include, but are not limited to:</p>

        <li>Writers</li>
        <li>Voice Acting</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Development Team Titles and Their Meanings</h2>
    <p>Depending typically on experience and seniority. Typically outlined (from top to bottom) as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead</li>
        <li>Principle</li>
        <li>Senior</li>
        <li>(no prefix)</li>
        <li>Junior</li>

        <li>Assistant</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A note on Agile Development</h2>
    <p>Commonly found in the gaming industry but works differently. An important strategy and work dynamic to understand as it is often utilized.</p>
    <p>Only 3 Roles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensures Agile methodologies are followed and runs Sprint Retrospection and helps with that process.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents the game to ensure the best possible product is made.</li>
                <li>Runs the Sprint Review meeting and signs off on work performed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Team Member</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Everyone else.</li>
                <li>The team as a whole defines and decides roles of the ‘team members’ and the tasks they perform and are responsible for.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Size will likely determine the number and type of roles (and role-crossovers) a company has.</li>
        <li>AI in the gaming world is different from what some may consider now in the real world (i.e. Generative AI, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc.).</li>
        <li>Building your game/project of existing technology is advised and encouraged (like utilizing Unreal Engine instead of designing and developing your own game engine).</li>
        <li>Don’t be the ‘smartest person’ on the team – it’s not solely your game anymore – let the team do the work they are there for.</li>
        <li>Selecting and staying on the right team and electing the right role for you in the process of game development is very important to keep in mind. Happy developers typically create great games.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Lecture 3.2: Contractors vs. Employees</h2>
    <p>It is important to consider if you are going to have fulltime employees or contract out certain aspects of the game and project under development. Employees require a lot of costs that may not be directly related to the game in development (such as benefits). Contractors may be more specialized and cheaper to hire for really specific tasks. It is important to consider all details when deciding to elect to hire employees or work with outside contractors.</p>

    <h3>Factors and Costs to consider:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Payroll Taxes (social security, unemployment, etc.)</li>
        <li>Benefits (health insurance, dental, retirement, etc.)</li>
        <li>Profit Sharing (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Employee Development (Tradeshows, Conventions, Training, etc.)</li>
        <li>Equipment / Workspace Costs</li>
        <li>Insurance and Legal Costs (don’t forget about cyber security)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of these costs do not apply to contractors and therefore should be taken into consideration when deciding which type of workers to hire. Contractors will likely be cheaper but have lower levels of investment and commitment to the project.</p>

    <h3>Factors to consider when working with contractors:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Contracts</li>
        <li>Essential / Non-Essential Roles</li>
        <li>Behavior and Commitment</li>
        <li>Financial Aspects</li>
        <li>Relationship (short-term)</li>
    </ul>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Below is my Week 2.0 Teachback Journal:</p>

            <ul><h2>Journal:</h2>
                    <li>Tasks performed this week included:</li>
                        <ul>

                <h2>Teachback:</h2>
                    <li>What did you learn this week in class?</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul><h3>This week’s lecture presented and addressed the following subject areas:</h3>
                    <ul><li>Funding sources to consider when writing a business plan.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Exit strategies to consider for the end-of-life of the business or project (and what your role is).</li></ul></ul>
                    
               
 
        <h2>Lecture 2.1: Money (Funding Sources)</h2>
        <p>How do you deal with the money coming in and where does it come from?</p>

      
        <h2>Sources of Funding (PROs/CONs)</h2>
        
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>You have to pay your employees, buy and maintain your equipment, pay for operation costs (bills) and many other financial obligations in order to maintain a healthy business.</p>
        
        <h3>Factors to consider when looking at funding sources:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Access and Relationship</li>
            <li>Structural Requirements</li>
            <li>Terms/Ownership</li>
            <li>Terms/Consequences of failure</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Funding Source: Friends and Family Loans</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The idea that you utilize those who you know and are close to you that would be willing to help you out. Not everyone has access to this funding source because not everyone has a rich uncle/friend willing to lend them money. Easy to negotiate terms.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Flexibility, potential quick access to funds, closer connection and drive to the project/business, usually strong self-ownership is required.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Informal, can potentially harm normally healthy relationships with friends and family, limited amount of funds (depending on how rich your uncle really is), can be a very co-dependent funding source (not allowing you to seek other sources of funding easily/if at all). Not feasible for everybody.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Make sure to have and maintain clear expectations and agreements between all parties. Be sure to run a transparent business with clear and open communication. Seek other funding sources or profitability quick to diversify funding.</p>
        
        <h3>Funding Source: Bootstrapping</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Essentially using your own financial means as a way to fund the company. This type of funding can facilitate any type of structure, ownership terms, management terms, and repayment because it is all of your own risk, money, and liability.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Include having full control over all administrative and ownership decisions which also include the easy of transferring the company/project and payback. Requires a lot of focus and discipline inorder to achieve profitability.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> You are the limited resource that finances everything – you are taking on a lot of risk (and also potential reward). May be slower in the development process because of the lack of skills and abilities. Limited access to networking and mentorship relationships that may come from other sources of funding.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Stay Lean – Reinvest your revenue – seek grants and other outside financial sources to help you when possible – seek mentorship and guidance from outside sources and mimic that who have been successful before you.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Credit Cards</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Using lines of credit as a source of funding for your company and project. Not an extremely ideal option because of the high-risk involved and the high-rate of repayment needed by the credit givers. This type of funding source can however be very flexible and facilitate any structure and ownership or management style.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Fast and easy.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Expensive and risky!</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Don’t. Seek other options first. Only use as a last resort and in cases of high-confidence of strong positive ROI (return on investment and profitability of the company/project).</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Bank / SBA Loans</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Precise terms and conditions with predictable repayment timeframe. Little to no involvement from the source of funding. Reasonable rates and terms. Longer payback timeframes.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Typically, hard to get for game development. May require collateral. Loans have to be repaid and may come with certain restrictions on what type of business you can create. No connection/lack of mentorship from funding source.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Plan ahead and make sure to have thorough and detailed plans for repayment. This includes planning for all stages of growth and development of the project or business (including start-up and no-profit times). Have a contingency plan.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Angel Investors</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Selling off the ownership, management, or some level of control of the company or project to a wealthy company or individuals that have the means to fund you. This type of funding may encompass a lot of structure requirements, ownership and management terms, and repayment stipulations.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Great opportunities for mentorship. Increase credibility of your company and/or project. No repayment obligation. Lesser financial worry and potentially beneficial flexible terms.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Multiple owners mean you have less control. Potential for disagreement and dissolution of you or the business/project. Pressure for high and quick returns. May dictate exit terms/expectations.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Do your homework and proper due diligence. Pick the right investors that have clear agreements and contracts that make sense to you. Be clear about your vision and goals to ensure you pick the right angel investor.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Venture Capital</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Essentially being invested into by a venture capital firm who sees the potential and growth of your project or company. In return they take a stake of ownership in the business. This is a very competitive funding source that comes with a plethora of structural requirements, ownership and management terms, and exit stipulations. This type of funding can come in stages and may come from a very specialized venture capital firm.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Can mean a significant investment in growth and capital. No repayment obligations (for you). Great access to networking and mentorship opportunities. The terms are clear and well known.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Very competitive and hard to secure. Can lead to equity dilution. Strong pressures for growth, profits, and success. Loss of control over management and administrative decisions. Complex terms and conditions and a dictated exit strategy (for you).</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Do your homework and proper due diligence. Pick the right investors that have clear agreements and contracts that make sense to you. Be clear about your vision and goals to ensure you work with the right venture capital firm.</p>

        <h3>Funding Source: Crowdfunding</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A strategy that is similar to bootstrapping and/or friend/family funding but seeks further grassroots type investment. Enables the company to sell securities (or shares) to a large group of investors online. Heavily dictated by government regulations. Must be a corporation structured business in-order to sell shares. Typically, flexible repayment obligations that can be agreed upon with shareholders. Engages in an audience that is interested in what you are trying to achieve with your business.</p>
        <p><strong class="pros">PROs:</strong> Surge of capital. No repayment obligations. Engaged shareholders and audience.</p>
        <p><strong class="cons">CONs:</strong> Equity dilution. Heavy government regulatory requirements (including lots of disclosure). Management of many investors who may be more highly engaged that in other funding sources.</p>
        <p><strong2><i>Mitigation:</i></strong2> Legal representation is a must – this can be a very complex and involved process. Be willing to engage with your audience and get them as heavily invested and involved in the vision and goals of the company/project as possible.</p>

        

        <h2>Lecture 2.2: Exit Strategies</h2>
        <p>What happens to the company when you are gone? How are you going to close down your company?</p>

        <h3>Key Points to Remember:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A good idea to write the ending first so you know where you are going.</li>
            <li>Investors want to know when and how they will get paid. This is also important to know the timeframe of when you anticipate cashflow to start coming in.</li>
            <li>The type of exit that you anticipate for the company can affect your work and approach to it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Some important factors to consider when choosing an exit:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Does your funding source mandate this?</li>
            <li>How likely or probable is the exit strategy?</li>
            <li>How do you want to exit your company? What is your personal-preference and does it align with your long-term goals?</li>
            <li>Market conditions and timing are also important. Is there a company out there willing to buy or consume your company or game?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Options for Exit Strategy</h2>
        
        <h3>Perpetuity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan to have the company to live on forever. It is important to keep into consideration if this is possible for you (when do you want to leave). Is the ‘default’ strategy until you define a different approach.</li>
            <li>What works with you funding source? Will there be profits to pay for the game into the future? Will you investors/funder agree to this type of exit? Don’t forget to create a process of succession.</li>
            <li>What are your long-term goals? Are you seeking a big pay-out or the ability to retire?</li>
            <li>Don’t forget about customer loyalty and the importance of branding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Acquisition or Merger</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Planning to have another company or individual buy you out.</li>
            <li>This is really good approach if you are hoping for a <strong>big-payout</strong>.</li>
            <li>Allows for your dreams of the company and/or game to live on.</li>
            <li>This is only possible if the company or project is feasible. A company will only buy you out if you are desirable.</li>
            <li>After an acquisition or merger you are losing control – your employees may also be greatly affected by new ownership and leadership. Some of them may not be needed or redundant.</li>
            <li>Once acquired the new parent company will likely want to make their money back as soon as possible and this may change internal dynamics. This may cause firings and discomfort as the company becomes more profit hungry.</li>
            <li>The negotiations for this type of exit strategy can be painful and hard. There are a lot of details that need to be ironed out between the two parties involved.</li>
            <li>It’s important to do your due diligence when utilizing this strategy. Do your research – some mergers/acquisitions may be looking to liquidate everything. Is the financial gain worth what you are giving up? Will your project/company live on the way you want it to (or is the money worth giving that up?)</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your final contracts and agreements. What will be the naming rights going forward? What does your involvement look like (if at all?). Make sure to have well-versed legal support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Go Public (IPO)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your business becomes publicly traded on the stock market.</li>
            <li>This does not happen very often – generally really large companies and gaming projects are capable of doing this.</li>
            <li>Creates an opportunity for a surge in funding and may provide a great opportunity for you to cash in (if you have stock options and the company is doing well).</li>
            <li>Provides the opportunity for you to retain control. However your company is now owned by your shareholders and their demands.</li>
            <li>Allows for stock offerings for you and your employees.</li>
            <li>This is a very complicated process. There are a lot of legal regulatory and reporting requirements. Becoming publicly traded on the stock market comes with a lot more requirements for transparency.</li>
            <li>This is not an easy process. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered in very detailed way. This may take away from the project or companies main goals/development. A lot of preparation is needed before hand when going through this process to be successful. Research!</li>
            <li>Prepare your employees for this process and be as transparent as possible in the process.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Management Buyout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A strategy where the managers buy the company or project from the owners.</li>
            <li>May be a viable option if funding is difficult or hard to get at first.</li>
            <li>Not a payout for you. You are paying your investors.</li>
            <li>May be difficult to do because the shareholders or stakeholders may not want to give up control. What is the reasoning behind this approach?</li>
            <li>Do your research and due diligence. Professional legal services will be crucial in-order as smooth as possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Similar approach to above where the employees gain ownership of the company and also reap the benefits.</li>
            <li>Payout is limited – depending on the purchasing power of your employees.</li>
            <li>Not typically preferred or feasible for a lot of funding sources (like venture capital or angel investors).</li>
            <li>Not extremely common and may be tough approach to accomplish.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Liquidation or Sell-off</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An approach that involves selling everything off and liquidating the company.</li>
            <li>May be the most viable and feasible option at the time.</li>
            <li>Important to determine and consider who owns what and what percentage of products or services, capital on-hand, intellectual property assets, etc.</li>
            <li>This can be a very fast strategy that is born out of necessity of the environment that the company or game project lives in. This can also be a very crude and dirty/tough process.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Discussion Post</h2>
            <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What information do we need to make an intelligent decision about the exit structure of our example company?</p>
            <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What exit strategy is best for this company and why?</p>
            <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> What are the pros and cons of this exit strategy and how do they relate directly to the information you know about the company, industry, and projects?</p>
            
            <h3>Guidelines and Expectations</h3>
            <p>Start by posting a description of your example company, any products it will be creating, and any other relevant information you think is important for making the decisions as to which exit strategy is best.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>My Discussion Post: </h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>There are several important factors that impact the exit strategy decision making process for the game development project and company that I am working with. It is also important to note that there are many factors that should be considered when deciding on an exit strategy for any business but because of the unique aspects of the project that I am working on I have gone with the following strategy outlined below.</p>
        <p>Before delving deeper into the exit strategy for the company/project here is pertinent important information that has been taken into consideration in the development of the business plan and further fleshes out the scope and details of the project.</p>
        <p>The name of the project/game being developed is “Rhythm Racer”. The team developing the game is comprised of students who are actively involved in this project for course work. The team describes the game as such:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Rhythm Racer is an atmospheric driving rhythm game in which players will enjoy a narrative scenic drive. Depending on the genre of the song each environment will differ giving players variation. While they enjoy not only the challenge of the rhythm of the song there will be a small story paired alongside it.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Essentially, a racer-type game developed with rhythmic elements and storylines played alongside music.</p>
        <p>Taking these aspects into consideration for this pseudo-fictional game development company and this project, the route I have chosen for an exit strategy is <strong>acquisition</strong>. Ultimately, in my eyes, if the game is developed and polished enough to be attractive for purchase by a bigger-larger company that can take the game and run with it that would be a win-win for those involved. This does bring in a lot of questions regarding the development of the game – however – being that it is done in an academic setting by students. Those details and stipulations need to be ironed out in the acquisition contract with the new parent company. Giving the students the experience and acclaim of selling off a game they developed would be a great success for all of those involved. Although this goal and vision may be lofty, it is still feasibly accomplishable – and therefore the exit strategy I have elected.</p>
        <p>Some other options for exit-strategies for this type of development/project/company that I considered included donating the game to the public sphere for academic use (because of how it was developed) or just simply allowing the game to run on forever (a perpetuity exit-strategy) but ultimately decided acquisition would work best in theory. There are also cons to be considered but I believe they are outweighed by the pros because of the academic value gained by the students. The cons include loss of control and ownership of the game/project, potential loss of administrative and managerial roles in the further development of the game, among other consequences of being acquired. Due diligence in the future must be taken when working on the actual contracts that implement the acquisition or merger.</p>

    <h2>Guest Speaker - Jeremy Johnston, Game Developer "The Roottrees are Dead"</h2>
    <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>He developed and created the game The Roottrees are Dead which has recently gained popularity. He talked about the start and growth of the idea at Game Jams and how he was initially able to flesh out the idea in a classroom at UAT.</li>
        <li>He talked about releasing the game and the outlets he utilized in further development of the game. For example, using online communities such as Discord and Reddit.</li>
        <li>His experience was interesting because he initially released the game for free seeking donations, but never really focused on the monetization of the game.</li>
        <li>Passion and being a huge fan of his own game and its development seemed to be a key theme that helped Jeremey be successful at releasing the game.</li>
        <li>He talked about stumbling on an interested investor and developer who jumped on board to re-make and release the game without the AI Artwork (which was the rational for a free-release of the game concept).</li>
        <li>Part of his experience with successful game development and launch he attributed to luck and chance. However, I believe his behaviors and community engagement really helped getting the exposure he needed to stumble upon and create the relationships he needed to be successful.</li>
        <li>Important lessons when monetizing a game:
            <ul>
                <li>Initial investment and development costs are paid back first.</li>
                <li>Some games are successful because of luck and chance opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Other generally important lessons he learned and noted:
            <ul>
                <li>Constant iterations that incorporate end-user feedback allow the game to morph and grow as it is developed.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In his experience he first developed an “under-cooked” storyline and back stories. User-feedback ultimately provided the need for more meaningful content and a better game.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are many different paths and ‘happy accidents’ that occur in the development of a game, that when addressed appropriately, can greatly enhance the final product.</li>
                <li>Playtest with all types of end-user (players) as possible – constructive and critical feedback is vital.
                    <ul>
                        <li>He attributed this to making the game more flexible by providing better user experience and playability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As a developer – we are our harshest and worst critics. We often forget this. </li>
                <li>Tutorials and how you ease users into the playability of a game are very important. He advised not to be afraid of making games harder in earlier-on stages to introduce important information and mechanics of a game.
                    <ul>
                        <li>But don’t frontload everything – gradually adding in more ‘tutorials’ for game mechanics is also an important factor to keep in mind.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Localization and translating a game into different human languages can be a very tricky and challenging process and may take more time and effort to implement than intially thought and expected. It’s important to consider your ROI (return on investment) when doing this.</li>
                <li>Hint systems and how they are implemented are important to consider when developing a game. His advice is that there is no reason to shame or gatekeep puzzle game players when considering the ability to ‘cheat’ and move forward features that are built into the game.</li>
                <li>Don’t over-antagonize players unless you really intend to. It’s not a good strategy if you want to be a likable and recommendable game.</li>
                <li>He notes that positivity and passion are important characteristics to embody in game development.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Rhythm Racer Business Plan Development (Discussion Post/Assignment)</h2>
    <p> This sections highlights the primary post that was used in the Canvas Discussion boards for the class.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <h3>Prompt: Tell us the important details about the company you are using for this class.</h3>
    <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Rhythm Racer</p>
    <p>I have been partnered with a team working on a game project entitled “Rhythm Racer” that is being developed at UAT by students. The game is a racing-style game that looks to add in rhythmic features and functionality of music and song. The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5. The project is currently in week 9 of a 15 week project timeline. I am just getting to meet the team and have started to get a better understanding of the game and development stage they are at.</p>

    <h3>Prompt: What business structure would you recommend based on the project / company you have chosen?</h3>
    <p>The business structure that I have chosen for this business plan is to create a Limited Liability Company (LLC) for the reasons outlined and detailed below:</p>

    <h3>Prompt: Evaluate and Justify why.</h3>
    <p>There are a variety of important factors that have led me to decide on forming an LLC for Rhythm Racers. The first and arguably one of the most important is the fact that LLC’s combine the benefits of sole proprietorship with the limited liability projection of corporations. This allows the owners (team members and stakeholders) to not be generally liable for the company’s debts or legals issues. LLC’s also provide for desirable benefits such as pass-through taxation – meaning the company is not directly taxed but rather profits and losses are reported on the owner’s personal income tax returns – this avoids double taxation.</p>
    <p>Some of the other important factors that went into the decision to elect an LLC are because LLC’s provide for operational and management flexibility over that of a corporation. This is a small team with a short timeline – flexibility and the ability to adapt quickly are paramount in-order to ensure on-time deliverability and completion without major delays and setbacks that can often come from big corporations that require a lot more formal documentation, change management and tracking, and approvals for changes.</p>
    <p>Another important factor to keep in mind is that LLC’s are relatively cheap and easy to form. This flexibility is desirable for a small team and project like Rhythm Racer. LLC’s typically do not require nearly as much formal documentation, agreements, contracts, profit/loss projections, etc as say the formation of larger corporations with deeper pockets and more stringent demands/requirements from shareholders/stakes holders.</p>
    <p>Further rational for choosing an LLC business structure over sole proprietorship or a partnership are because of the liability protection provided to the owners and members of the LLC.</p>

        <li>How do you plan to use it in the future?</li>
        <ul><li>Having the skillset to build and develop a business plan and select the approriate business structure is a strong marketable skill to showcase in a resume or portfolio. I will use it as such. </li></ul>
        <li>What information would you add to this lesson to gain additional insight on the topic?</li>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Below is my Week 0.5 Teachback Journal:</p>

            <ul><h2>Journal:</h2>
                    <li>Tasks performed this week included:</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Build Teach Back Journal Website</li>
                        <li>Review Course Introduction Material for the class</li>
                        <li>Completed First-day Survey</li>
                        <li>Attended and Reviewed the Live Lecture</li>
                        <li>Reviewed Module Content (Course Overview Powerpoint)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                    <li>For the first 0.5 week of the course I attended the live session and built a simple website to showcase my course work. After reviewing the powerpoint that was presented in class I learned about the important aspects that will be covered in this class specically related to legal and administrative sides of the economics of the gaming industry.</li>
                <h2>Teachback:</h2>
                    <li>What did you learn this week in class?</li>
                    <ul><li>I learned this week in class that our main project for the class will be building a business plan for a fictional gaming company. I have elected to work with a group that is working on an actual game to add a better real-world experience in developing the fictional business plan.</li>
                    <li>The general layout and design of the course and its contents on UAT's Canvas along with what the assignments and course content looks like.</li>
                    <li>We learned about funding sources for gaming companies and how complex they can be. We learned about the importance of legal issues and are reminded that the professor is not a lawyer. We learned about the complexities of employees and employee relations and how to handle expectations. The lecture also covered the intricacies of opening a bank account for a gaming business and the legal issues to be concerned about to ensure proper licencing and ownership.</li>
                <li>The lecture also covered the importance of insurance and how to work around problems that may arise with IP (Intellectual Property). We learned about the realities of game funding and what realistic expectations of financial gain are. Finally we learned about some out-side sources to go to for support when you feel like you are alone.</li></ul>
                    <li>How does this information relate to things you have studied in other classes or earlier in this course?</li>
                    <ul><li>The information is relatable because it gives an insight to the business side of coding and gaming. Whereas other courses have looked at the more technical aspects of game and application design, this couse focuses on the business development side. </li></ul>
                    <li>What material stood out to you? How did your view of the industry / job of producer change based on what you learned?</li>
                    <ul><li>All of the material related to the salary and financial gain aspect of the gaming industry stood out to me. I feel like it is a common mistake for all people to think that creating and maintaining a profitable buisness comes easy. From what I have seen, studied, researched and have been told by those with real world experience - this simply is not the case - and furthermore that a lot of businesses don't make it very far at all.</li></ul>
                <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
                    <li>Why is the information we covered in class important? Why did we spend our valuable time learning it?</li>
                    <ul><li>
                        The business and financial side of the gaming industry is extremely important to understand. It is the foundation of any business and without it, a business will not be able to survive. We spent our valuable time learning it because it is essential to understand how to manage a gaming company effectively, from funding to legal issues, and employee relations.</li>
                    </li></ul>
                    <li>How do you plan to use it in the future?</li>
                    <ul><li>I plan to apply the information learned in class in the real world when approaching interaction and transactions in the gaming industry. I hope having a deeper understanding of the business side of operations will help make me a better student, employee, and leader.</li></ul>
                    <li>What information would you add to this lesson to gain additional insight on the topic?</li>
                    <ul><li>Nothing to note so far being that it is only the first 0.5 week of class.</li></ul>
